# supertrend-bot

Supertrend bot using python (pandas and ccxt)

#### Instruction

Class SupertrendBot (supertrend.py) is mainly used to run bot. Quickly read through the `__init__` of this class to learn how to initiate an object (an individual bot).  

An example of a bot is `bot_matic.py`.

## Notes in implemetation
- Filled position is different from calculated position (e.g. position = lot / price). It's safer to update position from exected order's returned result. Good for trade log and avoid getting error for selling more than what you actually bought.
- Exchange requires >1 second or much more to update its prices. So if you request prices miliseconds right after the candle closes, you WILL NOT get the latest price candle (latest price row). [Read more here.](https://docs.ccxt.com/en/latest/manual.html#notes-on-latency)
- Choosing the optimal configuration when trading on small timeframe (e.g. 15m) require large historical data. Because 1000 data points of 15m timeframe only covers ~10 days, which is very bias (specifically, what if it's downtrend during that period)



# Roadmap

Week 1 (04/07)
- Write buy/sell logic: Create TP mechanism for Supertrend - Done
- Check the math after TP and trendChange - Done. TP at 1:1 cut a part of the profit while most of which is achieved in very long trend. Additionally, such long trends are not many. Thus, less profit in the end.
- Back-test Supertrend, observe results with different config as well (length, multiplier (maybe 1->5)) - Done

Week 2 (18/7):
- Use ccxt to forward-test / Create class as an account 
- Forward testing (with variable 'balance'?)

Week 3 (25/7):
- Use test API ByBit for forward testing, compare result after 2 weeks with shorten past data of the same length.

Week 4 (1/8/2022):
- Use real API Binance with little money (Current Profit/Loss: -3.5)
- 📍 Use larger historical data to find optimal configuration:
    - https://docs.coinapi.io/#limits
- Plot chart for further insights: https://dygraphs.com/ + JS

In queue:
- ALGO: Write buy/sell logic: Set order when RSI escaped overbought>75/oversold<25 (threshold) zone, TP/SL: half if move x amount (if touch TP, set SL to entry), half if touch the opposite threshold
- ALGO: Use deep learning (e.g., LSTM) 
- To execute real order, use official API from Exchange
- Set up alarm (for every execution?)

## Notes
- 1000 datapoints of 5m time-frame cover 3.6 days => $12
